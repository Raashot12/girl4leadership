**Chelsea have announced Hakim Ziyech has signed for Galatasaray on a permanent transfer.**



Ziyech joined Galatasaray on loan from the Blues for the 2023/24 season with a view to making the deal permanent.



There was confusion over whether this clause was optional or obligatory - reports claimed the latter, while Galatasaray themselves intimated it was actually the former.



Nevertheless, Ziyech's move to Turkey on a permanent basis has now been confirmed.\
\
Chelsea said in a statement: "Hakim Ziyech has completed a permanent transfer to Galatasaray.



"Ziyech initially joined the Turkish giants on loan last summer but has now departed Chelsea on a permanent basis.



"The 31-year-old signed for Chelsea from Ajax in the summer of 2020 and went on to make 107 appearances. He scored 14 goals for the Blues and won the Champions League, UEFA Super Club and FIFA Club World Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge.

"We thank Hakim for his efforts during his time at Chelsea and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his career."



Galatasaray's statement said: "Professional football player Hakim Ziyech's final transfer was made free of charge as the free purchase option conditions in the temporary transfer contract were met.



"The football player will be paid a net seasonal wage of 2,850,000 euros for the 2024-2025 season. In addition, in accordance with the agreement, if the conditional extension option is realised, the football player will be paid a net seasonal salary of 2,850,000 euros for the 2025-2026 season."



Ziyech has left Chelsea on a free transfer but they stand to make money if Galatasaray sell him due to a sell-on clause in the deal.
